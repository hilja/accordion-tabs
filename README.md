# Tab / accordion demo

Tabs on wide screens, accordion on small.

See demo [here][1]

Uses mostly just CSS. JS does only two things: adds and removes an attribute.

Have a look in the `scss/objects/_navigation.scss` all the good stuff is there. And JS is in `js/src/author.js`.

Works in Chrome, FF, Safari and IE9.
