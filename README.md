# Tab / accordion demo

Tabs on wide screens, accordion on small.

See demo [here][1]

Uses mostly just CSS. JS does only two things: adds and removes an attribute.

Have look at: `scss/objects/_tab-accordion.scss` and `scss/objects/_vertical_tabs.scss`, all the good stuff is there. And JS is in `js/src/author.js`.

Works in Chrome, FF, Safari and IE9.
