# Acordion tabs

Tab experiments: tabs that fold into an accordion on small screens. Uses mostly just CSS. JS only adds and removes an attribute.

See demo [here][1]

There's a bit of infrastructure in the demo but you'll find the good stuff on following files:

- `scss/objects/_accordion-tabs.scss`
- `scss/objects/_accordion-tabs-vertical.scss`
- `js/src/author.js`

## Browser comparability

Tested in FF, Safari, Chrome, and IE9.

## Running the demo

If you wish to run the demo on your machine:

1. `$ git clone https://github.com/hilja/tabs-accordion.git`
2. `$ cd tabs-accordion`
2. `$ npm install`
